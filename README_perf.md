Introduction
------------

The quazar-compute perf plugin is designed to collect performance data and virtual machine lifecycle events using the perf subsystem in Linux. It provides a lightweight and efficient way to collect performance data and VM lifecycle events, while also allowing for flexible collection intervals and easy integration with other systems. 

Main Features
--------------

The quazar-compute perf plugin has the following main features:

1. Utilizes the perf subsystem in Linux to collect performance data and VM lifecycle events.
2. Provides a Golang libperf package for lightweight marshaling of libperf functions.
3. Offers a perf package to provide a subset of perf functionality for Golang.
4. Uses separate goroutines to achieve flexible collection interval management.
5. Orchestrates collectors to provide correct performance data and VM lifecycle events collection.
6. Formats data into multi-JSON data reports for easy analysis and integration with other systems.
7. Writes data to Apache Kafka instances using a writer.
8. Provides logging for errors and debug data.
9. Supports execution management via Golang context to ensure a clean shutdown without data loss.

Modularized Design
------------------

The quazar-compute perf plugin is designed in a modularized manner, with each module providing a specific functionality. 

1. Linux Perf Subsystem Module: This module provides the core functionality for collecting performance data and VM lifecycle events. It includes the pre-compiled version of libperf.so, which is compiled from the source code of the perf subsystem in Linux.

2. Golang Libperf Module: This module provides a lightweight marshaling of libperf functions for Golang. It allows Golang to use the core functionality of libperf.so to collect performance data and VM lifecycle events.

3. Perf Package Module: This module provides a subset of the perf functionality for Golang. It provides a simplified interface for collecting performance data and VM lifecycle events.

4. Collector Management Module: This module manages the collectors used to collect performance data and VM lifecycle events. It uses separate goroutines to achieve flexible collection interval management, allowing collectors to be started and stopped independently.

5. Data Formatting Module: This module formats the collected data into multi-JSON data reports for easy analysis and integration with other systems.

6. Kafka Writer Module: This module writes the multi-JSON data reports to Apache Kafka instances for further processing and analysis.

7. Logging Module: This module provides logging for errors and debug data. It records any errors that occur during collection or data formatting, as well as debug data that can be used to troubleshoot issues.

8. Execution Management Module: This module supports execution management via Golang context. It allows the plugin to be started and stopped cleanly, without data loss.

Main Interface Design
---------------------

The quazar-compute perf plugin provides the following interfaces:

1. Start(): This interface starts the collectors to begin collecting performance data and VM lifecycle events.

2. Stop(): This interface stops the collectors and stops the collection of performance data and VM lifecycle events.

3. SetConfig(config: Config): This interface sets the configuration for the plugin. The configuration file specifies the collectors to use, the collection intervals, and the Apache Kafka instances to write data to.

4. GetData(): This interface retrieves the performance data and VM lifecycle events that have been collected. The data is formatted into multi-JSON data reports.

5. LogError(error: Error): This interface logs errors that occur during collection or data formatting.

6. LogDebug(debugData: DebugData): This interface logs debug data that can be used to troubleshoot issues.

7. Shutdown(ctx: context.Context): This interface supports execution management via Golang context. It allows the plugin to be shut down cleanly without data loss.

How to use?
------------

1. Install the plugin on your Linux system.

2. Once the plugin is installed, start it by running the plugin executable.

3. Configure the plugin by modifying the configuration file. The configuration file specifies the collectors to use, the collection intervals, and the Apache Kafka instances to write data to. 

4. Once the configuration file is set up, start the collectors by running the start command. This will begin the collection of performance data and VM lifecycle events.

5. The collected data will be formatted into multi-JSON data reports and sent to the specified Apache Kafka instances using a writer.

6. Monitor the performance data and VM lifecycle events using your preferred data analysis and visualization tools.

7. To stop the plugin, use the stop command. This will shut down the collectors and stop the collection of performance data and VM lifecycle events.

8. If necessary, you can also modify the configuration file and restart the plugin to adjust the collection intervals, change the collectors used, or change the Apache Kafka instances data is written to.

Conclusion
----------

The quazar-compute perf plugin provides a lightweight and efficient way to collect performance data and VM lifecycle events using the perf subsystem in Linux. Its modularized design allows for easy maintenance and customization, while its main features, including flexible collection intervals, multi-JSON data reports, and easy integration with other systems, make it a valuable tool for performance analysis and optimization.
